# Image Processing Techniques Demonstration

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates various image processing techniques using the OpenCV library. The script loads an image, applies different techniques such as Gaussian blur, Sobel edge detection, Canny edge detection, histogram equalization, and contrast stretching, and visualizes the results.

## About

Image processing is a crucial field in computer vision that enhances and manipulates images for various applications. This repository serves as an educational resource to showcase the effects of popular image processing techniques on a sample image. The script and explanations provided here can be useful for beginners learning about image processing concepts.

## Techniques Demonstrated

The following image processing techniques are demonstrated in the script:

- Gaussian blur: Smooths the image to reduce noise and details.
- Sobel edge detection: Highlights edges by detecting intensity gradients.
- Canny edge detection: Identifies edges by looking for rapid intensity changes.
- Histogram equalization: Enhances contrast and visibility by redistributing pixel values.
- Contrast stretching: Adjusts intensity values to improve the dynamic range of the image.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies (OpenCV and Matplotlib) if not already installed.
3. Replace `image_path` in the script with the path to your own image.
4. Run the script using a Python interpreter.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- Matplotlib (`pip install matplotlib`)
